# custom-camera-rom-beep-tone-converter
An experimental beep tone to image converter for the [Game Boy Camera rom project](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/custom-camera-rom)

Simple to use: 
* Record a sound file of the tone generator feature (in mono ideally, but stereo works too). Best results were obtained with a webcam microphone placed against the console speaker and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Mobile phone recordings gave very bad results due to some active noise filtering. Ogg format is recommended;
* Run the code with GNO Octave or Matlab by pointing at your audio file;
* Enjoy your image transmitted by sound !
